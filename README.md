# FNF Neko Engine (SUPER WIP)
A Port of Friday Night Funkin' Port for `neko` target (like build for windows but more faster)

This is a **SUPER WIP** mod, which means that it's not ready to be used yet

Also, if you gonna use this engine, dont worry about your disk, dont need to have visual studio thing yay!

# Some tip for Neko Engine only
- If you gonna make own State or SubState, replace `MusicBeatState` or `MusicBeatSubstate` with `MusicBeat` or `MusicBeatSub` (idk why thought but i like this :>)
- Neko Engine is using only `neko` build so if you gonna making da mod using this engine, try `lime build neko` (can be run on windows, macos or linux) (will execute by your opera system you using, like windows will execute as normall `.exe` file!)
# Some issues still in Neko Engine:
- Uncaught exeption `max_string_size reached` (already fixed but i need to checked first)
- some gui make game crash (included icon,...)
- icon game still not being readded
- charting state cannot played song when pressing space
# Some info:
I really need help ;_;
