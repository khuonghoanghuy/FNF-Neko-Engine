# FNF Neko Engine (SUPER WIP)
A Port of Friday Night Funkin' Port for `neko` target (like build for windows but more faster)

This is a **SUPER WIP** mod, which means that it's not ready to be used yet

Also, if you gonna use this engine, dont worry about your disk, dont need to have visual studio thing yay!

# Some tip for Neko Engine only
- If you gonna make own State or SubState, replace `MusicBeatState` or `MusicBeatSubstate` with `MusicBeat` or `MusicBeatSub` (idk why thought but i like this :>)
- Neko Engine is using only `neko` build so if you gonna making da mod using this engine, try `lime build neko` (can be run on windows, macos or linux) (will execute by your opera system you using, like windows will execute as normall `.exe` file!)
# Some bug still in Neko Engine:
- Since Engine was build on `neko` target so there will have alot bug that `windows` target was ;_;
- Fix Uncaught exeption `max_string_size reached`
